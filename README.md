# Welcome

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not a coder by trainingâ€”I'm a **solutions designer**, **consultant**, and **strategic problem-solver**. 

I specialize in taking complex business challenges and breaking them down into actionable strategies. My work involves mapping user journeys, defining system architectures, and creating implementation roadmaps that teams can actually execute. I work at the intersection of strategy, design, and technology to help organizations navigate challenges and unlock new possibilities.

Whether it's untangling organizational complexity, designing user-centered experiences, or architecting systems that scale, I bring a holistic perspective that goes beyond traditional coding boundaries.

Let's connect and explore how we can solve interesting problems together.

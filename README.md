# Welcome

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not a coder by trainingâ€”I'm a **solutions designer**, **consultant**, and **big thinker**. 

My approach is rooted in understanding complex problems from multiple angles and designing elegant solutions that bridge the gap between vision and execution. I work at the intersection of strategy, design, and technology to help organizations navigate challenges and unlock new possibilities.

Whether it's untangling organizational complexity, designing user-centered experiences, or architecting systems that scale, I bring a holistic perspective that goes beyond traditional coding boundaries.

Let's connect and explore how we can solve interesting problems together.
